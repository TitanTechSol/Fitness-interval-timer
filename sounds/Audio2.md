# Action Detection Messages

If you are sitting
If you are standing
If you are reading
If you are in the room
If you are complaining
If you are touching your mouse
If you are touching your keyboard
If you are lecturing
If you are staring off into the void of nothingness
If you are sipping coffee or tea
If you are on a video call
If you are writing in a notebook
If you are checking your phone
If you are adjusting your chair
If you are stretching your back
If you are pacing around the room
If you are looking out the window
If you are scrolling on social media
If you are jotting something on a sticky note
If you are rearranging your desk
If you are opening a desk drawer
If you are tidying up papers
If you are checking the clock again
If you are tossing something in the trash bin
If you are listening to music or a podcast
If you are fiddling with a pen
If you are yawning
If you are adjusting your headset
If you are plugging in a charger
If you are turning on a desk lamp
If you are tapping your foot
If you are spinning in your chair
If you are getting up for a snack
If you are taking a deep breath
